the website's general design:

Anime Anxiety's website is a nocturnal haven for anime enthusiasts, wrapped in a **dark theme** with **#23272A** and accented with moonlit grays and vibrant blues and purples to mirror the enigmatic anime cosmos. There are both dark and light themes. The homepage greets visitors with a dynamic banner and the inviting tagline, "Dive into the Digital Dojo of Anime Anxiety!" The site's layout is a narrative of Anime Anxiety's evolution, featuring a video gallery linked to their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@animeanxiety) and an interactive Discord section with custom popups, accessible via [Discord invites](https://discord.gg/EHdRmS3jDP). Social media icons beckon users to connect further.

Customization is key, with icons and emojis echoing beloved anime series, alongside interactive links that animate on hover, bringing the anime world to life. Content-wise, the site offers engaging anime category descriptions and a fan art section to celebrate community creativity. For an enhanced user experience, consider a dark/light mode toggle, lazy loading for media, and accessibility features like alt text and contrast ratios to cater to all users.
